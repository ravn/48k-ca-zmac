# 48k-ca-zmac

This repository is a bug report directory for http://48k.ca/zmac for Claude Code to update its findings in.

I found when working on disassembling some old Z80 PROM code that the output Claude got from z80dasm caused zasm to crash, and asked it to fix it.  

## Developer notes

### MacOS

On MacOS you need XCode from the App store, possibly also including the command line tools.

### Linux 

You need a full compiler tool chain, including gcc and bison.

For Ubuntu:

    apt install build-essential
